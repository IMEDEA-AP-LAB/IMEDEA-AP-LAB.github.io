# Research Areas

## Current Projects

### Mediterranean Sea Circulation Dynamics
**Duration:** 2024 - 2027  
**Funding:** Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation  
**Description:** Investigating the role of mesoscale eddies and deep water formation in Mediterranean Sea circulation patterns using in-situ observations and numerical modeling.

### Climate Change Impacts on Western Mediterranean Oceanography
**Duration:** 2023 - 2026  
**Funding:** European Research Council (ERC)  
**Description:** Long-term study of temperature, salinity, and circulation changes in the Western Mediterranean basin and their connection to global climate variability.

### Coastal-Open Ocean Interactions in the Balearic Sea
**Duration:** 2025 - 2028  
**Funding:** Balearic Government & EU Regional Funds  
**Description:** Understanding the exchange processes between coastal waters and the open Mediterranean Sea, focusing on nutrient transport and ecosystem dynamics.

## Research Themes

### Physical Oceanography
Our core research focuses on understanding Mediterranean Sea dynamics, including:
- **Water Mass Formation**: Deep and intermediate water formation processes
- **Circulation Patterns**: Basin-scale and mesoscale circulation dynamics
- **Mixing Processes**: Vertical and horizontal mixing mechanisms
- **Frontal Dynamics**: Formation and evolution of oceanic fronts

### Climate Oceanography
Investigating the Mediterranean Sea's role in regional and global climate:
- **Climate Variability**: Interannual to decadal oceanographic changes
- **Heat Exchange**: Air-sea interaction and heat budget studies
- **Sea Level Changes**: Regional sea level variability and trends
- **Extreme Events**: Marine heatwaves and severe weather impacts

### Observational Oceanography
Advanced measurement techniques and data analysis:
- **In-situ Observations**: CTD profiling, moorings, and glider deployments
- **Remote Sensing**: Satellite oceanography and data integration
- **Time Series Analysis**: Long-term oceanographic monitoring
- **Quality Control**: Data validation and uncertainty quantification

## Methodologies
- **Numerical Modeling**: ROMS, NEMO, and regional ocean models
- **Data Analysis**: Statistical oceanography and time series analysis
