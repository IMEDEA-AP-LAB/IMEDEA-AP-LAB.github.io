The **Ananda Pascual Lab** at the Mediterranean Institute for Advanced Studies (IMEDEA) focuses on understanding the **physical processes that govern ocean circulation across a wide range of spatial and temporal scales** ‚Äî from turbulent submesoscale motions to basin-scale currents ‚Äî and their interactions with the atmosphere, cryosphere, and biosphere.

We combine **in-situ observations, satellite remote sensing, numerical modelling, and machine learning** to study key processes such as vertical transport, energy cascades, ocean-atmosphere coupling, and the response of the ocean to climate variability and change. Much of our work is carried out in regions of particular interest for global climate, such as the **Mediterranean Sea and the Southern Ocean**.

Our interdisciplinary approach contributes to improving climate predictions, understanding extreme events, and developing Digital Twins of the ocean. We actively collaborate with international partners and participate in leading research initiatives, including field campaigns, technology development, and operational oceanography.
