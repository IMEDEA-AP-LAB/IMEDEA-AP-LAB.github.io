The **Ananda Pascual Lab** at the Mediterranean Institute for Advanced Studies (IMEDEA) focuses on understanding the dynamics of the Mediterranean Sea and its role in regional and global ocean systems. Our research combines observational oceanography, numerical modeling, and data analysis to investigate physical processes in the Mediterranean Sea.

## Research Focus

Our laboratory specializes in **Physical Oceanography** with particular emphasis on:

- **Mediterranean Sea Dynamics**: Regional oceanographic processes and climate interactions
- **Ocean Circulation**: Water mass formation, mixing processes, and circulation patterns  
- **Marine Sciences**: Interdisciplinary research combining physics, chemistry, and biology
- **Coastal Oceanography**: Near-shore processes and land-sea interactions
- **Climate Change**: Impact of global warming on Mediterranean oceanography

## Current Research Highlights

- Investigation of Mediterranean water mass variability and deep water formation
- Advanced numerical modeling of regional ocean circulation patterns
- Climate change impacts on Mediterranean oceanography and marine ecosystems
- Observational studies using autonomous gliders and oceanographic moorings
- Air-sea interaction processes and their role in regional climate

## Facilities & Instrumentation

Our laboratory is equipped with state-of-the-art instrumentation for oceanographic research:
- **CTD sensors** for temperature, salinity, and depth measurements
- **Autonomous underwater gliders** for long-term observations
- **Oceanographic moorings** for time-series data collection
- **High-performance computing** facilities for numerical modeling
- **Satellite data processing** capabilities for remote sensing applications
