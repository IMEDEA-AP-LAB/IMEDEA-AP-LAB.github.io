The **Ananda Pascual Lab** at IMEDEA advances our understanding of ocean circulation through cutting-edge research spanning multiple scales, from submesoscale turbulence to basin-wide currents and their complex interactions with climate systems.

We integrate **in-situ observations, satellite remote sensing, numerical modeling, and machine learning** to decode ocean dynamics, with focused expertise in the Mediterranean Sea and Southern Ocean regions.

## Research Areas

**Ocean Dynamics** — Investigating mesoscale and submesoscale processes, energy cascades, and vertical transport mechanisms

**Satellite Oceanography** — Developing altimetry applications, multi-platform observation strategies, and SWOT mission contributions

**Climate Studies** — Analyzing marine heatwaves, ocean-atmosphere coupling, and climate variability patterns

**Data Science** — Applying machine learning to oceanography with physics-informed algorithms and advanced forecasting

We actively collaborate with researchers worldwide and welcome motivated students and scientists to join our team. Explore our [projects](/projects/), meet our [team](/people/), and discover our [publications](/publications/).
