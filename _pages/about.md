The **Ananda Pascual Lab** at IMEDEA focuses on understanding physical processes governing ocean circulation across multiple spatial and temporal scales, from submesoscale turbulence to basin-scale currents, and their interactions with climate systems.

Our research combines **in-situ observations, satellite remote sensing, numerical modeling, and machine learning** to study ocean dynamics, with particular emphasis on the Mediterranean Sea and Southern Ocean regions.

## Research Areas

- **Ocean Dynamics**: Mesoscale and submesoscale processes, energy cascades, vertical transport
- **Satellite Oceanography**: Altimetry applications, multi-platform observations, SWOT mission
- **Climate Studies**: Marine heatwaves, ocean-atmosphere coupling, climate variability
- **Data Science**: Machine learning in oceanography, physics-informed algorithms, forecasting
