## Current Research Projects

### CALYPSO: Characterizing submesoscale processes in the Mediterranean Sea

**Funding:** Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation  
**Duration:** 2022-2025  
**PI:** Dr. Ananda Pascual

The CALYPSO project aims to characterize submesoscale processes in the Mediterranean Sea using a combination of in-situ observations, satellite data, and numerical modeling. We focus on understanding energy cascades between mesoscale and submesoscale motions and their role in vertical transport.

**Key Objectives:**
- Analyze energy transfer between different spatial scales
- Study vertical transport mechanisms at submesoscales
- Integrate multi-platform observations (gliders, SWOT, altimetry)

### SWOT Mediterranean Applications

**Funding:** European Space Agency  
**Duration:** 2023-2026  
**PI:** Dr. Ananda Pascual

This project leverages the Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite mission to study fine-scale ocean dynamics in the Mediterranean Sea, with particular focus on mesoscale and submesoscale processes.

**Key Objectives:**
- Develop new algorithms for eddy detection using SWOT data
- Validate satellite observations with in-situ measurements
- Study Mediterranean circulation at unprecedented spatial resolution

### Marine Heatwaves in the Balearic Sea

**Funding:** Regional Government of the Balearic Islands  
**Duration:** 2024-2027  
**PI:** Dr. Ananda Pascual

Research focused on understanding the mechanisms driving marine heatwaves in the Balearic Sea region, their frequency, intensity, and impacts on marine ecosystems.

**Key Objectives:**
- Characterize marine heatwave events in the western Mediterranean
- Identify physical drivers and predictability patterns
- Assess ecosystem impacts and vulnerability

## Completed Projects

### Mediterranean Mesoscale Variability (2018-2022)

**Funding:** Spanish National Research Council  
**PI:** Dr. Ananda Pascual

Comprehensive study of mesoscale variability in the Mediterranean Sea using satellite altimetry and in-situ observations.

### Ocean-Atmosphere Interactions (2020-2023)

**Funding:** European Commission (Horizon 2020)  
**PI:** Dr. Vincent Combes

Investigation of ocean-atmosphere coupling processes in coastal and open ocean regions, with focus on upwelling systems.
