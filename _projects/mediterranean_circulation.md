## Results & Impact

[Summary of key findings and their significance]

## Objectives

1. **Characterize mesoscale eddy activity** in the Western Mediterranean using satellite altimetry and in-situ observations
2. **Quantify deep water formation rates** in key convection sites (Gulf of Lion, Southern Adriatic)
3. **Develop improved parameterizations** for ocean models based on observational findings
4. **Assess climate change impacts** on circulation patterns and water mass properties

## Methodology

### Observational Approach
- **Autonomous glider deployments** for high-resolution temperature and salinity profiles
- **Oceanographic moorings** for long-term time series of current velocity and water properties
- **Satellite altimetry analysis** for sea surface height variability and eddy tracking
- **CTD surveys** during research cruises for validation and calibration

### Numerical Modeling
- **High-resolution regional models** (ROMS, NEMO) with 1-2 km horizontal resolution
- **Ensemble simulations** to assess uncertainty and variability
- **Data assimilation techniques** to incorporate observational constraints
- **Sensitivity experiments** to understand key physical processes

## Key Findings

Our research has revealed several important aspects of Mediterranean circulation:

- **Mesoscale eddies** contribute significantly to heat and salt transport, particularly in the Algerian Basin
- **Deep water formation** shows strong interannual variability linked to atmospheric forcing
- **Climate change** is altering the properties and formation rates of Mediterranean Deep Water
- **Coastal-open ocean exchange** is more complex than previously understood
