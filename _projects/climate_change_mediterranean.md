## Research Questions

1. How has Mediterranean Deep Water formation changed over the past 30 years?
2. What are the main drivers of temperature and salinity trends in the Western Mediterranean?
3. How do Mediterranean changes relate to global ocean and climate patterns?
4. What are the projected future changes under different climate scenarios?

## Approach

### Historical Data Analysis
- **Long-term hydrographic datasets** from 1990-present
- **Satellite sea surface temperature** time series analysis
- **Reanalysis products** for atmospheric forcing reconstruction
- **Paleoceanographic records** for longer-term context

### Process Studies
- **Seasonal monitoring** of key water masses and their properties
- **Event-based sampling** during extreme weather conditions
- **Cross-basin surveys** to understand spatial variability
- **Multi-platform observations** combining ships, gliders, and moorings

### Climate Modeling
- **Regional downscaling** of global climate models
- **Scenario projections** for 2050 and 2100
- **Impact assessment** on marine ecosystems and fisheries
- **Uncertainty quantification** using ensemble approaches

## Preliminary Results

Our analysis reveals significant changes in the Western Mediterranean:

- **Warming trend** of 0.03°C/year in deep waters since 1990
- **Salinification** of intermediate waters linked to increased evaporation
- **Weakening** of thermohaline circulation during warm periods
- **Increased stratification** affecting nutrient distribution

## Expected Outcomes

1. **Comprehensive assessment** of climate change impacts on Mediterranean oceanography
2. **Improved understanding** of regional climate-ocean interactions
3. **Enhanced climate models** with better Mediterranean representation
4. **Policy-relevant information** for Mediterranean countries
